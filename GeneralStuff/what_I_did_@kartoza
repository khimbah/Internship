1. I created a backup script to backup Petra's system so that she doesn't important files.
   I did that by running an rsync and update command on the ubuntu terminal.
   The aim was to install the Simple Scan version 3.18.2 but this happened to have a probrem running on Petra's ubuntu version 14.04.
2. We had to upgrade Petra's ubuntu to version 15.10 so that we can actually install and run Simple Scan 3.18.2
   I first had a hard time doing this. many times I did silly mistakes but thank God I had a very good support. All that was accomplished.
