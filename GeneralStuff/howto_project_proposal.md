#Importance
#Executive summaries are important as a communication tool in both academia and business. For example, Texas A&M University states that "An executive summary is an initial interaction between the writers of the report and their target readers: decision makers, potential customers, and/or peers. A business leaderâ€™s decision to continue reading a certain report often depends on the impression the executive summary gives."#
