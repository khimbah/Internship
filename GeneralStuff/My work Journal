What I did today_thursday 05-may-2016

what I did at the beginning of the day:

focus of the day: to sort every issue partaining network connection and to run a backup for Petra's system.
I sorted out the connection problem on Suzannes port...made extra cabling for the printer and Suzanne's pc. 
I made a backup for Petra's desktop. I learnt something about network file system and rsync.
Rsync is a tool for copying files to a remote host or computer. Rsync stands for "remote sync", where "sync" stands for synchronization or synchronizer. 
And network file system is a distributed file system that allows files and/or directories to be mounted on a remote server system.
 How I ran an rsync: 
This is the command that I ran on the terminal as super user:
#sudo su
#cd /home
#sudo rsync -av --progress petra/ /nfs-home/petra
