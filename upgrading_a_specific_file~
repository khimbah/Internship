If you wish to install the package if it doesn't exist, or upgrade it if it does, you may leave out --only-upgrade.


In order to update a single package using the CLI:

sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install <packagename>

e.g., sudo apt-get --only-upgrade install ack

Skipping **ack**, it is not installed and only upgrades are requested.
