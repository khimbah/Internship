Basic Networking

 The Network Interface Card

The NIC’s conversion process is straightforward, but
the technology is quite complex. In brief, the sender
NIC temporarily stores the computer’s digital signals,
encodes them and then generates the voltage for
transmission on the network. The process operates in
reverse at the receiver NIC. The network cable plugs
in to the front panel of the NIC.
