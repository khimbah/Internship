@khimbah ok so:
In your ~/.ssh/config put:

Host mountain
  User <your user name>
  HostName 196.214.55.116
  Port 8697

Then go to here:
https://github.com/inasafe/inasafe-infrastructure/tree/develop/ansible/pub_keys
Create an account for each user you find there like this:

sudo adduser <username>

Give them a unique password generated from keepass
then tell each user on gitter their credentials and to use the above setup to log in.
