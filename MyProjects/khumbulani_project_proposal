#This document is a proposal for an exercise-robotic project
#The purpose of building up this robotic is to provide an 
#exercise system that will track and display the number
#of times a ball is passed in front of it(the robotic)

#*Project Summary
  *Project Background:There have been some inventions to encourage and improve exercising. Most of these inventions were not so easy to apply especially by those individuals who were beginners or newbies to exercising.Some of these inventions caused injuries while some were almost impossible to use, especially for the obese and fat peoble. This led us to coming up with an idea to design a device that will encourage almost every one to engage into easy and enjoyable exercise activity.This also caters for the old aged and both genders. The nicest thing about this gadget is that it encourages doing this in a team or couples.It can actually help clients to have fun while building muscles and losing weight.It can also help in building or maintaining social relationships. Organisations also can benefit much from this as this gadget can benefit the top management, middle management, supervisors and subordinates during break time after some tiring work just to kick out fatigue using this fun and easy to use gadget.This in turn can reduce slowing down of work and thus enhance productivity.
 
  *Project Objectives:

#*Project Methodology
  *The Project Approach Summary:
   First we are going to look into our toolbox,that is, what tools do we need in order for us to achieve this.
  *what expertise is needed to deal with this project.
  *do we have the tools (both hardware and software) orshould we buy or consider open source?
  *do we have the expertise (necessary skills and experience) or must we consider training or contractors?
  *We need a very good understanding of the nature of the problem and an understanding if what it would take to   *solve it. 
  *Finally, starting from our understanding of the problem, we break it down to chunks of manageable tasks:
We need hardware components for input, memory, processing and output. 
*Work Breakdown and Task Time Estimates:
#  *Project Deliverables:
1.Code #this is the instructions that will process input from users(external stimuli) and from memory.
2.Gadget (hardware without code/software) #this is the functional unit of integrated hardware components.
3.User Manual # this is a document with a set of instructions on how to use the product 
4.
