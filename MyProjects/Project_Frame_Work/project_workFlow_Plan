//This document is a work flow for object detection system project
#So what we need to do is create a circuit that will carry all the components we will use.
Work Flow:

#Input:
1.camera or sensor
code: what must happen if the sensor detects the ball
2.button(on/off)
code: what must happen when the button(on/off) is click

#Output:
1.diplay:
 a.how to connect the screen to the arduino?
 b.programming the arduino to display on the screen
 c.what do we want to display?
 d.we will display 'hello' when 'on' button is pressed, 'bye' when 'off' button is pressed.
 e.we will display 'count' after the ball passes the sensor and as the ball is being thrown, and 'sum' when pressing 'score' button 
 f.and 'reset'and clear the screen and last results when reset button is pressed.
2.sound(beep every time the ball passes by the sensor):
 a. code to make our arduino make some noise(beep, that is, 'if' the sensor can detect the ball)
 b. every time there is a beep, 'count' must be incremented by 1
 c. eventually, 'count' will be stored in 'sum'
#Process: Buildind a component supporting circuit
#Electronic Components:
Part One: Input //buttons
connecting the buttons to the arduino
writing code to regulate the actions of the buttons
#the on/off button will complete the circuit and/or create an open circuit
#a complete circuit means on and an open circuit means off.
#the reset button will clear the screen and the memory,that is, the last results.
