//This document is a work flow for object detection system project

Work Flow:

#Input:
1.camera or sensor
code: what must the happen if the sensor detects the ball
2.button(on/off)
code: what must happen when the button(on/off) is pressed

#Output:
1.diplay:
 a.how to connect the screen to the arduino?
 b.programming the arduino to display on the screen
 c. what do we want to display?
 .we will display 'hello' when 'on' button is pressed, 'bye' when 'off' button is pressed.
 .we will display 'count' after the ball passes the sensor and as the ball is being thrown, and 'sum' when pressing 'score' button 
 .and 'reset'and clear the screen when reset button is pressed.
2.sound(beep every time the ball passes by the sensor):
 a. code to make our arduino make some noise(beep, that is, 'if' the sensor can detect the ball)
 b. every time there is a beep, 'count' must be incremented by 1
 c. eventually, 'count' will be stored in 'sum'
#Process:
