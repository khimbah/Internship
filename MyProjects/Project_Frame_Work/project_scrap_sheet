#important:
A jump wire, is a short electrical wire with a solid tip at each end (or sometimes without them, simply "tinned"), which is normally used to interconnect the components in a breadboard. PE: among others, they are used to transfer electrical signals from anywhere on the breadboard to the input/output pins of a microcontroller.[1]

Jump wires are fitted by inserting their "end connectors" into the slots provided in the breadboard, that beneath its surface has a few sets of parallel plates that connect the slots in groups of rows or columns depending on the area. The "end connectors" are inserted into the breadboard, without soldering, in the particular slots that need to be connected in the specific prototype.
