You’ve decided that you’re going to work on issue #53 in whatever issue-tracking system your company uses. 

#To create a branch and switch to it at the same time, you can run the git checkout command with the -b switch:

#$ git checkout -b iss53
Switched to a new branch "iss53"

This is shorthand for:

#$ git branch iss53
#$ git checkout iss53
