 The Network Interface Card

You have read about the encoding methods to
transmit digital signals on networks. What about the
hardware that makes this possible? Any computer that
operates in a network environment uses a Network
Interface Card (NIC) to convert signals processed in a
computer, to signals that meet standards for the
network. The device may also have a facility to
convert signals from one network standard to
another.

The NIC’s conversion process is straightforward, but
the technology is quite complex. In brief, the sender
NIC temporarily stores the computer’s digital signals,
encodes them and then generates the voltage for
transmission on the network. The process operates in
reverse at the receiver NIC. The network cable plugs
in to the front panel of the NIC.
